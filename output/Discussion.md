When dealing with a large log file (up to 1TB),we need an efficient and scalable approach to extract log entries for a specific date. 
Below is a detailed breakdown of the approach:

1.Challenges We Must Overcome:
->Memory Efficiency: The file is too large to load into memory at once.
->Processing Speed: We need to extract relevant logs as quickly as possible.
->Disk I/O Optimization: Reading and writing must be efficient.
->Scalability: The approach should work for even larger files.

2. Steps to Solve the Problem
Step 1:
->Read the File Line by Line (Memory-Efficient Approach)
->Instead of loading the entire file into memory (which is impractical for large files), we process it line by line.
->We use Python’s open() function with a with statement to handle files safely.
->Reading line by line avoids memory overload.

Step 2: 
Identify Relevant Log Entries (Filtering by Date)
->Typically, log files have timestamps in a structured format like:
        2024-02-26 12:30:45 INFO User logged in
->The assumption is that the log entry starts with the date (YYYY-MM-DD format).
->We use startswith(date) to check if the log line belongs to the requested date.


Step 3:
Write Extracted Logs to an Output File
->We store the filtered log lines in a new file (output_{date}.txt).
->To avoid excessive disk writes (which slow down performance), we use:
   Buffered writing: Writing in chunks rather than one line at a time.
   Appending instead of reopening the file each time.


Step 4: 
Error Handling (Robustness)
->File Not Found: If the file doesn’t exist, we provide a clear error message.
->Unexpected Errors: If something goes wrong (e.g., permission issues), we handle it gracefully.

3. Optimizations for Large Files

For very large files, we can optimize further:

Optimization 1:
Using mmap for Faster File Access
->mmap (Memory Mapping) allows reading parts of a file as if it were in memory.
->It speeds up processing without loading the full file.

Optimization 2: Multi-Threading for Parallel Processing
->If the log file is split across multiple files (e.g., daily logs), we can process them in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor.

4. Final Execution & Usage


How to Use the Script
->Save the script as extract_logs.py
->Run from the terminal:
  >python extract_logs.py /path/to/logfile.txt 2025-02-26

->Output file will be created as:
   >output/output_2025-02-26.txt
